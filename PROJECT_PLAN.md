- Tools: GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, NovelAI

### Step 3: Use AI to Generate Scene Sketches
- Create a simple sketch (draft) for each chapter, based only on the story and dialogue (no character or scenario final art yet)
- Tools: Python PIL, basic drawing libraries, or simple sketch generation tools

### Step 4: Use AI to Create Illustrations of Characters

- Save character art by emotion/pose

### Step 5: Use AI to Create Scenario/Background Illustrations
- Tools: Stable Diffusion (DreamShaper, MoDi), MidJourney
- Save backgrounds by scene

### Step 6: Combine Sketches and Illustrations to Create Webtoon-like Chapter
- Merge the scene sketches with the generated character and scenario illustrations
- Stylize combined panels into polished Webtoon pages
- Tools: Storyboarder, Manga Generator, Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint

### Step 7: Animate the Webtoon Panels
- Animate static panels into motion comic/anime video
- Tools: RunwayML Gen-2, Pika Labs, After Effects, Deformable Diffusion

### Step 8: Add Voiceovers and Sound Effects
- Voices: ElevenLabs, Play.ht
